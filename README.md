[Express Docs](https://expressjs.com/)

Express is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more. Express allows you to create server-side applications and APIs easily, with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.

[Nodemon Docs](https://nodemon.io/)

Nodemon is a development tool that improves the developer experience. It monitors your Node.js application for any changes in the code and automatically restarts the server whenever a change is detected. This eliminates the need to manually restart the server after every code modification, making the development process more efficient and productive. Nodemon is commonly used during development to save time and avoid the hassle of manual server restarts.

#### Thunder Client

#### Nanoid

[Nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid)

The nanoid package is a software library used for generating unique and compact identifiers in web applications or databases. It creates short and URL-safe IDs by combining random characters from a set of 64 characters. Nanoid is a popular choice due to its simplicity, efficiency, and collision-resistant nature.

#### Not Found and Error Middleware

The "not found" middleware in Express.js is used when a request is made to a route that does not exist. It catches these requests and responds with a 404 status code, indicating that the requested resource was not found.

On the other hand, the "error" middleware in Express.js is used to handle any errors that occur during the processing of a request. It is typically used to catch unexpected errors or exceptions that are not explicitly handled in the application code. It logs the error and sends a 500 status code, indicating an internal server error.

In summary, the "not found" middleware is specifically designed to handle requests for non-existent routes, while the "error" middleware is a catch-all for handling unexpected errors that occur during request processing.

#### MongoDB

[MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. It uses a document-oriented model, where data is organized into collections of JSON-like documents. MongoDB offers high performance, horizontal scalability, and easy integration with modern development frameworks, making it suitable for handling diverse data types and handling large-scale applications.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB, offering automated deployment, scaling, and monitoring of MongoDB clusters, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

#### Mongoosejs

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a straightforward and elegant way to interact with MongoDB. It allows developers to define schemas and models for their data, providing structure and validation. Mongoose also offers features like data querying, middleware, and support for data relationships, making it a powerful tool for building MongoDB-based applications.

#### express-async-errors

The "express-async-errors" package is an Express.js middleware that helps handle errors that occur within asynchronous functions. It catches unhandled errors inside async/await functions and forwards them to Express.js's error handling middleware, preventing the Node.js process from crashing. It simplifies error handling in Express.js applications by allowing you to write asynchronous code without worrying about manually catching and forwarding errors.

[Express Async Errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-errors)

#### Status Codes

A library for HTTP status codes is useful because it provides a comprehensive and standardized set of codes that represent the outcome of HTTP requests. It allows developers to easily understand and handle different scenarios during web development, such as successful responses, client or server errors, redirects, and more. By using a status code library, developers can ensure consistent and reliable communication between servers and clients, leading to better error handling and improved user experience.

[Http Status Codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes)

200 OK OK
201 CREATED Created

400 BAD_REQUEST Bad Request
401 UNAUTHORIZED Unauthorized

403 FORBIDDEN Forbidden
404 NOT_FOUND Not Found

500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR Internal Server Error

#### Bad Request Error

400 BAD_REQUEST Bad Request
401 UNAUTHORIZED Unauthorized
403 FORBIDDEN Forbidden
404 NOT_FOUND Not Found

#### Validation Layer

[Express Validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)

#### Hash Passwords

[bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)

const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
This line generates a random "salt" value that will be used to hash the password. A salt is a random value that is added to the password before hashing, which helps to make the resulting hash more resistant to attacks like dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks. The genSalt() function in bcrypt generates a random salt value using a specified "cost" value. The cost value determines how much CPU time is needed to calculate the hash, and higher cost values result in stronger hashes that are more resistant to attacks.

In this example, a cost value of 10 is used to generate the salt. This is a good default value that provides a good balance between security and performance. However, you may need to adjust the cost value based on the specific needs of your application.

const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
This line uses the generated salt value to hash the password. The hash() function in bcrypt takes two arguments: the password to be hashed, and the salt value to use for the hash. It then calculates the hash value using a one-way hash function and the specified salt value.

The resulting hash value is a string that represents the hashed password. This string can then be stored in a database or other storage mechanism to be compared against the user's password when they log in.

By using a salt value and a one-way hash function, bcrypt helps to ensure that user passwords are stored securely and are resistant to attacks like password cracking and brute-force attacks.

##### BCRYPT VS BCRYPTJS

bcrypt and bcryptjs are both popular libraries for hashing passwords in Node.js applications. However, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for a few reasons:

Cross-platform compatibility: bcrypt is a native Node.js module that uses C++ bindings, which can make it difficult to install and use on some platforms. bcryptjs, on the other hand, is a pure JavaScript implementation that works on any platform.

Security: While both bcrypt and bcryptjs use the same underlying algorithm for hashing passwords, bcryptjs is designed to be more resistant to certain types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks.

Ease of use: bcryptjs has a simpler and more intuitive API than bcrypt, which can make it easier to use and integrate into your application.

Overall, while bcrypt and bcryptjs are both good choices for hashing passwords in Node.js applications, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for its cross-platform compatibility, improved security, ease of use, and ongoing maintenance.

#### JSON Web Token

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and secure way of transmitting data between parties. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs. JWTs contain information about the user and additional metadata, and can be used to securely transmit this information

[Useful Resource](https://jwt.io/introduction)

JWT_SECRET represents the secret key used to sign the JWT. When creating a JWT, the payload (data) is signed with this secret key to generate a unique token. The secret key should be kept secure and should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

JWT_EXPIRES_IN specifies the expiration time for the JWT. It determines how long the token remains valid before it expires. The value of JWT_EXPIRES_IN is typically provided as a duration, such as "1h" for one hour or "7d" for seven days. Once the token expires, it is no longer considered valid and can't be used for authentication or authorization purposes.

These environment variables (JWT_SECRET and JWT_EXPIRES_IN) are read from the system environment during runtime, allowing for flexibility in configuration without modifying the code.

#### HTTP Only Cookie

An HTTP-only cookie is a cookie that can't be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser. It is designed to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to steal cookies and other sensitive information.

##### HTTP Only Cookie VS Local Storage

An HTTP-only cookie is a type of cookie that is designed to be inaccessible to JavaScript running in the browser. It is primarily used for authentication purposes and is a more secure way of storing sensitive information like user tokens. Local storage, on the other hand, is a browser-based storage mechanism that is accessible to JavaScript, and is used to store application data like preferences or user-generated content. While local storage is convenient, it is not a secure way of storing sensitive information as it can be accessed and modified by JavaScript running in the browser.

This line sets a cookie with the name "token" and a value of token, which is the JWT that was generated for the user. The ... represents an object containing additional options for the cookie.

httpOnly: true: This option makes the cookie inaccessible to JavaScript running in the browser. This helps to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to steal cookies and other sensitive information.

expires: new Date(Date.now() + oneDay): This option sets the expiration time for the cookie. In this case, the cookie will expire one day from the current time (as represented by Date.now() + oneDay).

secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production': This option determines whether the cookie should be marked as secure or not. If the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to "production", then the cookie is marked as secure, which means it can only be transmitted over HTTPS. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, which can intercept and modify cookies that are transmitted over unsecured connections.

##### Cookie Parser

[Cookie Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)

#### Setup Proxy

- only in dev env
- a must since cookies are sent back to the same server
- spin up both servers (our own and vite dev)

- server

This code configures a proxy rule for the development server, specifically for requests that start with /api. Let's go through each property:

'/api': This is the path to match. If a request is made to the development server with a path that starts with /api, the proxy rule will be applied.
target: 'http://localhost:5100/api': This specifies the target URL where the requests will be redirected. In this case, any request that matches the /api path will be forwarded to http://localhost:5100/api.

changeOrigin: true: When set to true, this property changes the origin of the request to match the target URL. This can be useful when working with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''): This property allows you to modify the path of the request before it is forwarded to the target. In this case, the rewrite function uses a regular expression (/^\/api/) to remove the /api prefix from the path. For example, if a request is made to /api/users, the rewritten path will be /users.

To summarize, these lines of code configure a proxy rule for requests starting with /api on the development server. The requests will be redirected to http://localhost:5100/api, with the /api prefix removed from the path.

#### Concurrently

The concurrently npm package is a utility that allows you to run multiple commands concurrently in the same terminal window. It provides a convenient way to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously.

By default, when a command fails, concurrently continues running the remaining commands. However, when --kill-others-on-fail is specified, if any of the commands fail, concurrently will immediately terminate all the other running commands.

#### Axios

Axios is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests from web browsers or Node.js. It provides a simple and elegant API for performing asynchronous HTTP requests, supporting features such as making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, handling request and response headers, handling request cancellation, and more.

[Axios Docs](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

#### React Router - Action

Route actions are the "writes" to route loader "reads". They provide a way for apps to perform data mutations with simple HTML and HTTP semantics while React Router abstracts away the complexity of asynchronous UI and revalidation. This gives you the simple mental model of HTML + HTTP (where the browser handles the asynchrony and revalidation) with the behavior and UX capabilities of modern SPAs.

#### Update User - Server

Multer is a popular middleware package for handling multipart/form-data in Node.js web applications. It is commonly used for handling file uploads. Multer simplifies the process of accepting and storing files submitted through HTTP requests by providing an easy-to-use API. It integrates seamlessly with Express.js and allows developers to define upload destinations, file size limits, and other configurations.

First, the multer package is imported.

Then, a storage object is created using multer.diskStorage(). This object specifies the configuration for storing uploaded files. In this case, the destination function determines the directory where the uploaded files will be saved, which is set to 'public/uploads'. The filename function defines the name of the uploaded file, which is set to the original filename.

Next, a multer middleware is created by passing the storage object as a configuration option. This multer middleware will be used to handle file uploads in the application.

In this case, upload is an instance of the Multer middleware that was created earlier. The .single() method is called on this instance to indicate that only one file will be uploaded. The argument 'avatar' specifies the name of the field in the HTTP request that corresponds to the uploaded file.

When this middleware is used in an HTTP route handler, it will process the incoming request and extract the file attached to the 'avatar' field. Multer will then save the file according to the specified storage configuration, which includes the destination directory and filename logic defined earlier. The uploaded file can be accessed in the route handler using req.file.

#### Mock Data

[Mockaroo ](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

#### Stats - Complete Server Functionality

[MongoDB Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/)

The MongoDB aggregation pipeline is like a factory line for data. Data enters, it goes through different stages like cleaning, sorting, or grouping, and comes out at the end changed in some way. It's a way to process data inside MongoDB.

Query parameters, also known as query strings or URL parameters, are used to pass information to a web server through the URL of a webpage. They are typically appended to the end of a URL after a question mark (?) and separated by ampersands (&). Query parameters consist of a key-value pair, where the key represents the parameter name and the value represents the corresponding data being passed. They are commonly used in web applications to provide additional context or parameters for server-side processing or to filter and sort data.

new URL(request.url): This creates a new URL object by passing the request.url to the URL constructor. The URL object provides various methods and properties to work with URLs.

.searchParams: The searchParams property of the URL object gives you access to the query parameters in the URL. It is an instance of the URLSearchParams class, which provides methods to manipulate and access the parameters.

.entries(): The entries() method of searchParams returns an iterator containing arrays of key-value pairs for each query parameter. Each array contains two elements: the parameter name and its corresponding value.

([...new URL(request.url).searchParams.entries()]): The spread operator ... is used to convert the iterator obtained from searchParams.entries() into an array. This allows us to pass the array to the Object.fromEntries() method.

Object.fromEntries(): This static method creates an object from an array of key-value pairs. It takes an iterable (in this case, the array of parameter key-value pairs) and returns a new object where the keys and values are derived from the iterable.

Putting it all together, the code retrieves the URL from the request.url property, extracts the search parameters using the searchParams property, converts them into an array of key-value pairs using entries(), and finally uses Object.fromEntries() to create an object with the parameter names as keys and their corresponding values. The resulting object, params, contains all the search parameters from the URL.

#### Debounce

[JS Nuggets - Debounce](https://youtu.be/tYx6pXdvt1s)

In JavaScript, debounce is a way to limit how often a function gets called. It helps prevent rapid or repeated function executions by introducing a delay. This is useful for tasks like handling user input, where you want to wait for a pause before triggering an action to avoid unnecessary processing.

#### React Query

React Query is a powerful library that simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization in React applications. It provides a declarative and intuitive way to manage remote data by abstracting away the complex logic of fetching and caching data from APIs. React Query offers features like automatic background data refetching, optimistic updates, pagination support, and more, making it easier to build performant and responsive applications that rely on fetching and manipulating data.
